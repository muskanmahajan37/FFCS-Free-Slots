### About FFCS

VIT University offers the **Fully Flexible Credit System** (FFCS) in its academic curriculum. Under this, students can register for courses according to their interests and academic abilities. **FFCS** allows students to decide their academic plan and permits them to alter it, if required, as they progress in time.

The slot-based timetable, coupled with internet based Course Registration in each semester, helps individual students to choose the course they want to study, time of attending a class and even the teacher. Thus, students can make their own timetable and each student in a class may have a different timetable of his/her own.
